## Installation

The extension is [downloadable on the Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/govuk-toolkit/dclfaikcemljbaoagjnedmlppnbiljen) and [AMO for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/govuk-browser-extension-ff/).

If you don't want to install from your browser's web store for security reasons, you can install a local non-self updating copy.

### For Chrome:

1. [Download the source from GitHub](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-browser-extension/archive/main.zip) and unzip.
2. Visit [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) in your browser.
3. Ensure that the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.
4. Click `Load unpacked extensionâ€¦` to pop up a file selection dialog.
5. Navigate to `src` in the extension directory, and select it.
6. Visit any page on [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk).

### For Firefox:

Extensions installed using the following instructions are only active while Firefox
is open and are removed on exit. Permanently-active extensions can be only be
installed from packages signed by Mozilla.

1. [Download the source from GitHub](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-browser-extension/archive/main.zip) and unzip.
2. Visit [about:debugging](about:debugging/runtime/this-firefox) in your browser.
3. Click `Load Temporary Add-on` to pop up a file selection dialog.
4. Navigate to `src` in the extension directory, and select `manifest.json`.

## Running the tests

You'll need jasmine-browser, which you can set up with:

```
$ npm install
```

You can then run the tests with:

```
$ npm test
```

This will start a server and run the tests in a browser (chrome by default).

If you want the browser to remain open with the test results, you can use

```
$ npx jasmine-browser-runner serve
```

..then navigate to http://localhost:8888/

## Releasing the extension

When a new version is merged to `main`, a new version of the extension is automatically packaged up and published to 
Firefox Add-ons and to Chrome web store. See [releasing.md](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-browser-extension/blob/main/docs/releasing.md)
