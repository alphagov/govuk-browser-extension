## Installation

The extension is [downloadable on the Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/govuk-toolkit/dclfaikcemljbaoagjnedmlppnbiljen) and [AMO for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/govuk-browser-extension/).

If you don't want to install from your browser's web store for security reasons, you can install a local non-self updating copy.

### For Chrome:

1. [Download the source from GitHub](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-browser-extension/archive/main.zip) and unzip.
2. Visit [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) in your browser.
3. Ensure that the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.
4. Click `Load unpacked extensionâ€¦` to pop up a file selection dialog.
5. Navigate to `src` in the extension directory, and select it.
6. Visit any page on [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk).

### For Firefox:

Extensions installed using the following instructions are only active while Firefox
is open and are removed on exit. Permanently-active extensions can be only be
installed from packages signed by Mozilla.

## Running the tests

In development, it's easiest to run:

```
$ bundle exec rake jasmine
```

This will start a server on http://localhost:8888/ that serves the tests.

You can also run the Jasmine test suite in slower "headless" mode with:

```
$ bundle exec rake jasmine:ci
```

## Releasing the extension

1. Update the version in `manifest.json`
2. Run `rake build`
3. Create a Pull Request with the new package committed
4. Upload newly created package in `/build` to the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole/06b3913d-07a7-479e-94aa-05bb5b3cd44d/dclfaikcemljbaoagjnedmlppnbiljen/edit/package). You will need to have been added to the [govukdevelopers google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/govukdevelopers) (at the time of writing, @andysellick, and @alex-ju).
5. Upload newly created package in `/build` to [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/govuk-browser-extension/versions/submit/). Account details in the [2nd line password store](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-secrets/tree/master/pass/2ndline/firefox).
