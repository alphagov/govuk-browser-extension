2. Visit [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) in your browser.

4. Click `Load unpacked extensionâ€¦` to pop up a file selection dialog.
5. Navigate to `src` in the extension directory, and select it.
6. Visit any page on [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk).

## Running the tests

You'll need jasmine-browser, which you can set up with:

```
$ npm test
```

You can then run the tests with:

```
$ npm test
```

This will start a server and run the tests in a browser (chrome by default).

If you want the browser to remain open with the test results, you can use

```
$ npx jasmine-browser-runner serve
```

..then navigate to http://localhost:8888/

## Releasing the extension

1. Update the version in `manifest.json`
2. Run `npm run build`
3. Create a Pull Request with the new package committed
4. Upload newly created package in `/build` to the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole/06b3913d-07a7-479e-94aa-05bb5b3cd44d/dclfaikcemljbaoagjnedmlppnbiljen/edit/package).
